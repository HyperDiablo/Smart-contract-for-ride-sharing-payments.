RideShare Payment Smart Contract

Introduction
The RideShare Payment Smart Contract is a decentralized solution built on the Aptos blockchain that facilitates secure and transparent payments between drivers and passengers in a ride-sharing ecosystem. This smart contract eliminates the need for traditional payment intermediaries while ensuring trust and reliability in ride-sharing transactions.

Vision

- Reduce transaction fees
- Increase payment security
- Provide instant settlements
- Ensure complete transparency
- Build trust between drivers and passengers
- Create an immutable record of all transactions

Core Features
-Secure Ride Initialization: Drivers can initialize rides with specific passenger details and fare amounts
-Automated Payment Processing: Smart contract handles the payment transfer from passenger to driver
-Built-in Security Checks: 
  - Verification of passenger identity
